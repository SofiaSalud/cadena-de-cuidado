    "\n",
    "You understand the acute and chronic definitions like:\n",
    "* Acute illnesses generally develop suddenly and last a short time, often only a few days or weeks.\n",
    "* Acute conditions are often caused by a virus or an infection but can also be caused by an injury resulting from a fall or an automobile accident, or by the misuse of drugs or medications.\n",
    "* Acute diseases come on rapidly, and are accompanied by distinct symptoms that require urgent or short-term care, and get better once they are treated. For example, a broken bone that might result from a fall must be treated by a doctor and will heal in time. Sometimes, an acute illness, such as the common cold, will just go away on its own. Most people with acute illnesses will soon recover. If hospitalized for an acute illness, after your condition improves, you’ll likely be eager to return to the comfort and familiarity of home. But being discharged from the hospital doesn’t mean you’re fully recovered. Learn more about measures can take to help hasten the return to your normal routine.\n",
    "* Examples of acute medical conditions: Asthma attack, Broken bone, Bronchitis, Burn, COVID-19, Common cold, Flu, Heart attack, Pneumonia, Respiratory infection, Strep throat.\n",
    "* Chronic conditions develop slowly and may worsen over an extended period of time—months to years.\n",
    "* Chronic conditions are often caused by unhealthy behaviors that increase the risk of disease—poor nutrition, inadequate physical activity, overuse of alcohol, or smoking. Social, emotional, environmental, and genetic factors also play a role. As people age, they are more likely to develop one or more chronic conditions.\n",
    "* Chronic conditions are slower to develop, may progress over time, and may have any number of warning signs or no signs at all. Common chronic conditions are arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and chronic kidney disease. Unlike acute conditions, chronic health conditions cannot be cured—only controlled. Living with chronic illness or managing the symptoms of a chronic condition can often be done by creating a health care plan in partnership with your physician—the plan may include taking medication, healthy eating, physical or occupational therapy, exercise, or complementary treatments, such as acupuncture or meditation. Frequently, chronic conditions can be prevented by practicing healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as staying physically active; maintaining a healthy weight and nutritional status; limiting sun exposure; and refraining from drugs, smoking, and excessive alcohol use.\n",
    "* Examples of chronic medical conditions: Alzheimer’s disease, Arthritis, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Depression, Diabetes, Heart disease, High blood pressure, High cholesterol, Obesity, Osteoporosis\n",
    "* Acute conditions are severe and sudden in onset. This could describe anything from a broken bone to an asthma attack. A chronic condition, by contrast is a long-developing syndrome, such as osteoporosis or asthma. Note that osteoporosis, a chronic condition, may cause a broken bone, an acute condition. An acute asthma attack occurs in the midst of the chronic disease of asthma. Acute conditions, such as a first asthma attack, may lead to a chronic syndrome if untreated.\n",
